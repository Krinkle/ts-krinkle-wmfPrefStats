The following queries are done, and sufficient indices in the database schema.

== Main query ==

	Examples:
		"Current usage of all preferences on all wikis"
		"Current usage of all preferences on all wikis (by active users)"
		"Current usage of all preferences on en.wikipedia.org"
		"Usage of all preferences on all wikis over time (between 2012-09-01 and 2012-10-01)"
		"Usage of all preferences en.wikipedia.org over time (between 2012-09-01 and 2012-10-01 - by active users)"

	Graph:
		y-axis: _total_ph_sum
		x-axis: ph_timestamp
		line: "{ph_propery}={ph_value}"

	Query:
		SELECT
			ph_timestamp,
			ph_property,
			ph_value,
			SUM(ph_sum) as _total_ph_sum
	
		FROM property_history

		GROUP BY ph_timestamp
	
		ORDER BY
			ph_timestamp ASC,
			ph_property ASC,
			ph_value ASC;

	Options:
		wikiid: [ "" = global | select wiki | \/ ]
			 {wikiid}
			 	? WHERE ph_wikiid={wikiid}
			 	:

		# (rangeFrom and/or rangeTo) or timestamp

		rangeFrom: [ "" = from begin | YYYYMMDD ]
			{rangeFrom}
				? WHERE ph_timestamp >= {rangeFrom}
				:

		rangeTo: [ "" = up until today | YYYMMDD ]
			{rangeTo}
				? WHERE ph_timestamp <= {rangeTo}
				:

		timestamp: ["" = most recent | YYYMMDD ]
			WHERE ph_timestamp={timestamp}

		activeOly: [_] Active users only.
			{activeOly}
				? SELECT SUM(ph_sum_active) as _total_ph_sum
				: SELECT SUM(ph_sum_active) as _total_ph_sum

		show/hide lines: (client side)


== Single property ==

	Examples:
		"Current skin usage on all wikis"
		"Current skin usage on en.wikipedia.org"
		"Skin usage on en.wikipedia.org by active users"
		"Skin usage on all wikis over time (between 2012-09-01 and 2012-10-01)"
		"Skin usage on en.wikipedia.org over time (between 2012-09-01 and 2012-10-01)"

	Query:
		SELECT
			ph_timestamp,
			ph_value,
			SUM(ph_sum) as _total_ph_sum
	
		FROM property_history

		WHERE	ph_property='skin'

		GROUP BY ph_timestamp
	
		ORDER BY
			ph_timestamp ASC,
			ph_value ASC;

	Options:
		wikiid: [ "" = global | select wiki | \/ ]
			 {wikiid}
			 	? WHERE ph_wikiid={wikiid}
			 	:

		property*: [ select property ]
			WHERE ph_property={property}

		rangeFrom: [ "" = from begin | YYYYMMDD ]
			{rangeFrom}
				? WHERE ph_timestamp >= {rangeFrom}
				:

		rangeTo: [ "" = up until today | YYYMMDD ]
			{rangeTo}
				? WHERE ph_timestamp <= {rangeTo}
				:

		activeOly: [_] Active users only.
			{activeOly}
				? SELECT SUM(ph_sum_active) as _total_ph_sum
				: SELECT SUM(ph_sum_active) as _total_ph_sum

		show/hide lines: (client side)

	Graph:
		y-axis: _total_ph_sum
		x-axis: ph_timestamp
		line: ph_value

	Comment:
		This is essentially the same as "Main query" except the query is slightly simpler,
		it an probably use the same backend and then the front-end will make sure to diplay
		label "value" on the lines instead of "key/value".


== Fetch properties ==

	Comment:
		Get a list of possible properties for use in a dropdown menu.

	Query:
		SELECT
			DISTINCT(ph_property) as ph_property
	
		FROM property_history
	
		ORDER BY
			ph_property ASC;

	Options:
		wikiid: [ "" = global | select wiki | \/ ]
			 {wikiid}
			 	? WHERE ph_wikiid={wikiid}
			 	:

		rangeFrom: [ "" = from begin | YYYYMMDD ]
			{rangeFrom}
				? WHERE ph_timestamp >= {rangeFrom}
				:

		rangeTo: [ "" = up until today | YYYMMDD ]
			{rangeTo}
				? WHERE ph_timestamp <= {rangeTo}
				:

		activeOly: [_] Properties used by active users only.
			{activeOly}
				? WHERE ph_sum_active > 0
